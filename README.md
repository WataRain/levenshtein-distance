# levenshtein-distance
Naive recursive implementation of Levenshtein distance in Python

Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into the other. This implementation is unfortunately an inefficient one, as it constantly recomputes the Levenshtein distance of the same substrings many times.
